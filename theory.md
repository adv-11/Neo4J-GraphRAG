A knowledge graph is a database that stores info in Nodes and Relationships

Both Nodes and Relationships can have Properties

Nodes can be given lavels to group them together

Relationships always have a type and a direction


How to create a Knowledge Graph ?

Then extract -> Identify information 

expand -> supercharge data

repeat -> connect info to expand context


#FROM TEXT SRC to MVG

1) Form (10K)  ->  2) Split Text   ->    3) Create Nodes   ->   4) Add Embedding   ->    5) Connect Chunks
